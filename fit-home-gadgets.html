    <ul>
      <li class="">
        I use typical items like dumbbells, ankle weights, weight vest, chinup bar, pushup handles,
        mat.
      </li>
      <li class="mt2">
        I use less common items like a <dfn>'DARD'</dfn> for the shins, one sided dumbbells for wrist movements, an old school
        neck harness.
      </li>

      <li class="mt2">
        Chairs are very useful, they hold weights, can be used for dips, support the back during one arm exercises.
        Gloves and even those soft
        spongy sanding blocks from the hardware store can pad hands and feet during dips and wrist and shin exercises
        for
        example.
      </li>
      <li class="mt2">
        A flight of stairs provides a nice cardio workout, (especially with some of the workout done wearing a weight
        vest). I start up two timers on the computer, one with the total time and one with a split time, to help me pace
        myself.
      </li>
      <li class="mt2">
        A piece of wood across 2 hex dumbbells provides a platform for calf raises. I use planks of wood, possibly
        stacked 2 or 3 high, as a stop to limit the lower range of motion for some exercises like deadlifts and dumbbell
        squats.
      </li>
      <li class="mt2">
        I fashioned an inexpensive clock for timing sets and rest intervals. It only has a second hand, and has seconds
        for digits on the face.

        <a class="link-style2" href="workout-timer2.html">
          Another option is the computer based workout timer that I wrote.

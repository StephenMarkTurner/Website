    <p class="">
      I wanted to upgrade my skills in web
      technologies, so I relearned the basics about web design. In the process, I learned about more modern
      considerations such as responsive design and accessibility. I also learned about problems such as complexity
      (especially in CSS) and modern approaches to controlling this such as Web Components.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      I wrote the HTML, ECMAScript (JavaScript), and some CSS.
      The fancy particle simulation is done by a program called 'particles.js'.

      I used a CSS library called Tachyons. It is a collection of small single purpose CSS classes, which allows more
      direct styling without relying on highly specified CSS selectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This type of CSS styling, while avoiding CSS complexity horrors, can also get tedious and repetitious. I developed
      a hybrid style, using a pseudo CSS class and an associated string containing the Tachyons classnames which are
      then applied to elements via script.

      The colour scheme is based on the black and gold of the City of Waterloo.

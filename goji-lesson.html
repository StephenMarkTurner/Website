      Biting It!</h2>

    <p>It seemed simple enough.</p>
    <p class="">A few years ago I went out for a bicycle ride in the morning. I had a modest breakfast consisting of a
      glass of fruit smoothie and some oatmeal and peanut butter, and set out about an hour later. I rode at a moderate
      intensity for about 3 hours. When I returned home I was feeling hungry, so I went out for a typical fast food
      lunch. About an hour or so after eating I felt quite ill, and proceeded to forcefully purge the food I had eaten.
    </p>
    <p>Lesson learned, right? Or was it confirmation bias?</p>
    <p>The following weekend I went out again for a slightly longer ride. I had the same, but larger, breakfast. The
      plan was to avoid the temptation to get any fast food afterwards. I rode for about 2 hours and was ready to turn
      around and return home, and that was when I started sensing that nauseated feeling again. I had a very unpleasant
      ride home, in fact I was actually sick several times mid ride.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the illness continued for over a week. I finally thought that I would change breakfast and see if
      that had any effect. To my surprise, it did! It took another week for the symptoms to completely dissipate. I then
      decided to try the ingredients from my original breakfast one at a time.</p>
    <p>Bingo! It seemed to be the goji berries that were in my smoothie. Not the greasy fast food that I first
      suspected.</p>
    <p>All in all, a terrific but quite painful lesson. I had briefly contemplated an emergency visit to the hospital
      (yes, the symptoms at times were that bad). Although I still eat a highly plant centric diet, I stay
      well clear of goji berries.</p>

            The Golden Ratio<br>

            The Golden ratio, often called 'Phi' and written as
            <var>&phi;</var>, is equal to<br>
            <var>(1 + &radic;5) / 2</var>
            or about 1.618.

        <p>
            If the ratio of two numbers is <var>&phi;</var>, then so is the sum of the numbers divided by the larger
            number. That is if<br>
            <var>a / b = &phi;</var>, then
            <var>(a + b) / a = &phi;</var>

            <br><var>(&phi; + 1) / &phi; = &phi;</var><br>
            Numerically,<br>
            <var>(1.618 + 1) / 1.618 = 1.618</var>
        </p>

        <p>
            The reciprocal of <var>&phi;</var> is equal to <var>&phi; - 1</var>. That is<br>
            <var>
                1 / &phi; = &phi; - 1, or<br>
                1 / &phi; + 1 = &phi;
            </var><br>
            Numerically,<br>
            <var>1 / 1.618 = 0.618</var>
        </p>
        <p>
            These equations are equivalent to the quadratic equation <var>x<sup>2</sup> - x = 1</var>.<br>
            The solutions to the equation are<br><var>(1 + &radic;5) / 2</var> and <var>(1 - &radic;5) / 2</var> or<br>
            <var>&phi;</var> and <var> 1 - &phi; = -1 / &phi;</var><br>
            Numerically,<br>
            <var>1.618<sup>2</sup> - 1.618 = 1</var><br>
            <var>(-0.618)<sup>2</sup> - (-0.618) = 1</var>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a way to create one geometrically. The 1/2 diagonal is equal to <br><var>&radic;5 / 2</var> times
            the side of the square.
            Adding this to 1/2 of the side of the square gives us a perfect Golden rectangle.

        <p>
            Some numeric sequences such as the well known <dfn>Fibonacci Sequence</dfn>
            are created by adding new terms that are the sum of the previous two terms.
            Theses types of sequences have terms whose ratio converges to
            <var>&phi;</var>. For example, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13..., the ratio of the last terms shown is (13 / 8) =
            1.625.

            The dimensions of a painting can be in a Golden ratio. This is subjective of course, but this is often
            considered to be a particularly aesthetically pleasing form. The placement of 'focal points' ie areas of
            most interest within the painting often follows the ratio.

            I am trying these sequences as templates for rep patterns. The decreasing rep goals suggest a reduced rest
            interval in between sets. For example, I like (10, 6, 4) and (13, 8, 5) as a 3 set
            rep range for a dumbbell squat using a 60 to 90 second interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            Useful 3 set patterns based on this concept might be a range such as (5, 3, 2), (6, 4, 2), (8, 5, 3), (10,
            6, 4), (13, 8,
            5), (16, 10, 6), (21, 13, 8), (26, 16, 10), (34, 21, 13).
        </p>
        <p>
            Some exercises seem to work better than others, if it doesn't feel right, use a more conventional rep range.

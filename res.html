    <p class="">
      I was born in 1956 in the UK, although I have lived most of my life in Southern Ontario, mostly in the Waterloo
      Region.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Athletically, I played both informal and organized sports. I represented the City of Waterloo in baseball (although
      to be honest I was mostly a benchwarmer). I represented my schools in track, wrestling, and soccer. 
      More informally, I played a lot of table tennis and badminton.
      I played a variety of community team sports (hockey, and even
      a little bit of football in addition to baseball).
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Academically, I received an Electrical Engineering degree from the University of Waterloo in 1984. I then worked as a computer
      programmer for many years, working both for famous companies identified by three letter acronyms, and for very small companies.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      My exercise focus is now primarily health based, although I still enjoy more demanding challenges on occasion. I love to walk, bicycle, lift weights,
      do light yoga and fitness kickboxing.
      I did one walk of well over 20 miles in 2018 in extreme heat, and I am planning to do a full walking marathon in 2020.
